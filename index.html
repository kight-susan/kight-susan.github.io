								<strong><a href="https://github.com/kight-susan/datascienceportfolio/blob/master/Spotify-k-NNexamplewithFlaskApp.ipynb">Spotify ‘Like’ Predictions</a></strong>
								<p>Using <strong><em>Python</em></strong> and <strong><em>Jupyter Notebook</em></strong>, leveraged Spotify data via an API to transform and clean the data to prepare it for training and testing a <strong><em>k-NN classification supervised learning model</em></strong>. Used in conjunction with a <strong><em>Flask App</em></strong> to make predictions using test parameters. Jupyter Notebook is available to view <a href="https://github.com/kight-susan/datascienceportfolio/blob/master/Spotify-k-NNexamplewithFlaskApp.ipynb">here</a>.</p>

								<strong><a href="https://rpubs.com/kights/unemploymentrateforecasting">Unemployment Rate Time Series Forecasting</a></strong>
								<p>Leveraged uni-variate <strong><em>time series</em></strong> data that was explored and fit against various models - <strong><em>linear regression, exponential smoothing, and ARIMA function</em></strong> - to find the <strong><em>best model</em></strong> using <strong><em>R</em></strong>. Model types were critiqued by fit, summary measures, accuracy, residuals (including <strong><em>autocorrelation</em></strong>), and then a <a href="https://rpubs.com/kights/unemploymentrateforecasting">forecast</a> was predicted.</p>

								<strong><a href="https://github.com/kight-susan/datascienceportfolio/blob/master/MovieReviewNLTK_and_TextBlobExample.ipynb">Foundational Text Analysis of Movie Reviews</a></strong>
								<p>Using <strong><em>NLP</em></strong> in <strong><em>Python</em></strong>, performed <strong><em>text processing</em></strong> and <strong><em>mining</em></strong> techniques including <strong><em>polarity and subjectivity</em></strong> to analyze a large dataset and drew key conclusions. Leveraged <strong><em>nltk, pandas, textblob and collections</em></strong> for the analysis. The Jupyter Notebook file is available <a href="https://github.com/kight-susan/datascienceportfolio/blob/master/MovieReviewNLTK_and_TextBlobExample.ipynb">here</a>.</p>

								<strong><a href="https://github.com/kight-susan/datascienceportfolio/blob/master/TransportationDataDeck.pdf">Airport Flight On Time Data Analysis</a></strong>
								<p>As part of a group project, <strong><em>data analysis and visualization</em></strong> were performed on a dataset from Bureau of Transportation Statistics using <strong><em>R</em></strong>. The data was cleaned and transformed, and then an <strong><em>in-depth analysis</em></strong> performed leveraging several libraries for the analysis and data visualization. Non-technical findings are <a href="https://github.com/kight-susan/datascienceportfolio/blob/master/TransportationDataDeck.pdf">here</a>.</p>

								<p><img src="images/fulls/first06.jpg" class="image fit thumb" alt="Sales" /></p>
								<strong><a href="https://rpubs.com/kights/multivariatetimeseries">Time Series Sales Forecasting by Strategy Type</a></strong>
								<p>Explored sales and advertising data in <strong><em>R</em></strong> and fitted it to a <strong><em>linear regression model</em></strong> evaluating for various diagnostics. Added additional lagged time series data (multi-variate) to <strong><em>improve the model fit</em></strong> and added the various data on strategy types. From the final model, a sales prediction was made following a particular strategy - a summary is provided <a href="https://rpubs.com/kights/multivariatetimeseries">here</a>.</p>

								<strong><a href="https://github.com/kight-susan/datascienceportfolio/blob/master/HospitalReadmissionSummary.pdf">Patient Readmission Predictions</a></strong>
								<p>Created a best performing <strong><em>logistic regression model</em></strong> that described and <strong><em>predicted the probability</em></strong> of a patient being readmitted within 30 days of leaving the hospital. This was developed using <strong><em>R</em></strong> and a summary of the procedure for the final model was  documented. A non-technical presentation of the <a href="https://github.com/kight-susan/datascienceportfolio/blob/master/HospitalReadmissionSummary.pdf">findings</a> are available.</p>

								<strong><a href="https://github.com/kight-susan/datascienceportfolio/blob/master/CustomerChurn.pdf">Best Model for Customer Churn Predictions</a></strong>
								<p>Using data from a telecommunication company, used <strong><em>R</em></strong> with the <strong><em>Rattle library</em></strong> to clean and transform the data before running <strong><em>SVM RBF, Neural Network, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Adaptive Boosting models</em></strong> to find the <strong><em>best performing model</em></strong> using <strong><em>AUC</em></strong> amongst other measures as a determinant.  A summary can be found <a href="https://github.com/kight-susan/datascienceportfolio/blob/master/CustomerChurn.pdf">here</a>.</p>

								<strong><a href="https://rpubs.com/kights/multitimeseriesbusridership">Regression Model Critiqued for Bus Ridership Predictions</a></strong>
								<p>Using bus ridership data for Iowa City Transit, created a <strong><em>regression model</em></strong> using <strong><em>multiple time series variables in R</em></strong> and critiqued the model for best fit and model accuracy. A <a href="https://rpubs.com/kights/multitimeseriesbusridership">R Markdown file</a> of the proceedure that was followed is available.</p>

								<h3>Optimization Model to Reduce Lost Revenue</h3>
								<p>For a fictional credit card company that had multiple options to reduce lost revenue, I used <strong><em>integer programming</em></strong> and created a model using <strong><em>Microsoft Excel’s Solver</em></strong> to find the best business decision of all the options. Also, re-solved the model based on additional criteria.</p>
